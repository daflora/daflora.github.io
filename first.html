      Hailing from the ever-so-distant and oh-so-evergreen slopes of the Sleeping Lady, Mt. Tamalpais, Daniel is excited to once again be touring the lands and grounds around his Alma Mater. Indeed, one could say he has EXTENDED his time at Berkeley.

      In addition to coding, full stack coding, front end coding, back end coding, coding, and coding, Daniel also loves to play his accoustic guitar, eat excellent food, and enjoy the weather.
